### How do I edit the config?
_This is just a temporary solution. In future versions we will enhance the ability to edit the config_

2. Right click PokemonGofBot.app and click _"Show Package Contents"_
3. Goto `Contents/Resources/app/gofbot/configs/config.json`
4. Follow [this](https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot/blob/dev/docs/configuration_files.md#sniping-movetolocation) guide to edit the `config.json`

#### Windows
Currently we do not know how to edit the config for Windows; however, in future versions we will add the ability to edit the config in the desktop application.
